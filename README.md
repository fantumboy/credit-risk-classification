# the purpose of this analysis was to predict the accuracy of a loan status (healthy or high-risk) of a given loan with machine learning. 

# the following are the results provided by our model:
# * accuracy 99%
# * precision 99%
# * recall 99%

# when we consider the number of data points that the model worked with and the accuracy, precision, and recall values given from the classification report, i would highly recommend this model to whichever company showed interest.
